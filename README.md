# Learn `python` for the Duke of Edinburgh bronze challenge

I am a Y9 student from Essex, UK. I am preparing for participating in the [Duke of Edinburgh](https://www.dofe.org/about/) bronze challenge in 2024.
I have decided to learn to write code in Python for my 'skill' challenge, and I will use GitHub to record my progress for my assessor.

I start almost from scratch, so my objectives are not very ambitious:
- to learn some Python,focused on data analysis (I like basketball, so it will be mostly about sports stats)
- to learn to work using version control in GitHub
- to learn Markdown and the use of Notebooks to give context to my code

I will record my progress below in diary format.

## Nov 12, 2023

- I set up an account in GitHub
 - I downloaded GitHub desktop
 - I learned what a repository and commit is.
 - I learned a bit of GitHub markdown
 - I have set up the environment manager Anaconda in my Acer Chromebook 314
 - I have started to learn to use the `pandas` library
   
## Nov 25, 2023

- Anaconda is going to be my environment manager.
- JupyterLab is going to be my IDE (interactive development environment).
- GitHub is going to be my version control system.

- An IDE is an application that helps develop software by providing a code editor, debugging software, and a system to run the code to check it works.
- An Environment Manager is an application that helps develop software by providing a controlled environment for the interpretation of the code: I will write my code in Python 3 and will use some specific libraries, like `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `nba_api`), and Anaconda will make sure that my code will be interpreted with the appropriate versions of Python and those and other libraries.
- A version control system will allow me to save my work without eliminating earlier versions, so I can go back in time and recover an older version of my code if I make a mistake. This will also help me keep a log of my progress for my DofE assessor.

My first aim is to set up my workflow. I can't yet use GitHub Desktop to synchronise my code repository in GitHun with the code in my chromebook.
That is what I will try oi resolve today. I am going to test other software, as proposed [here](https://www.systemadmin.uk/other/using-git-on-a-chromebook/).

The software proposed in that link unfortuntley is only acccesable with the operative system Ubuntu but the operative system i have right now is chromeOS. both are versiions of Linux however i am still not able to run GitKraken and GitAhead in my system.
