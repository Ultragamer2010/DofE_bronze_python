# Learn `python` for the Duke of Edinburgh bronze challenge

I am a Y9 student from Essex, UK. I am preparing for participating in the [Duke of Edinburgh](https://www.dofe.org/about/) bronze challenge in 2024.
I have decided to learn to write code in Python for my 'skill' challenge, and I will use GitHub to record my progress for my assessor.

I start almost from scratch, so my objectives are not very ambitious:
- to learn some Python,focused on data analysis (I like basketball, so it will be mostly about sports stats)
- to learn to work using version control in GitHub
- to learn Markdown and the use of Notebooks to give context to my code

I will record my progress below in diary format.

- Anaconda is going to be my environment manager
- jupyterjab is going to be my ide (interactive development environment)
