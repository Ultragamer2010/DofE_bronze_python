# Learn `python` for the Duke of Edinburgh bronze challenge

I am a Y9 student from Essex, UK. I am preparing for participating in the [Duke of Edinburgh](https://www.dofe.org/about/) bronze challenge in 2024.
I have decided to learn to write code in Python for my 'skill' challenge, and I will use GitHub to record my progress for my assessor.
